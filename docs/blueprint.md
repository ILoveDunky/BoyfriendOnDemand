- Primary color: Lavender (#d6b5f4) for main background accent.
- Background color: Warm Cream (#fbf7ff) to set an inviting atmosphere.
- Accent color: Dusty Rose (#e8b7c8) for heart effects and interactive elements to create the effect when selected.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata' for a literary, slightly formal feel.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use rounded buttons with a generous radius for a soft, approachable interface.
- Use soft pulses for button presses to create haptic feedback with any interative ui object on display.
- Incorporate gentle glow effects on hover states to bring awareness and make any UI effect look like it shines.
- Employ slow fade-in animations to add a smooth user transition into certain interfaces that give time for the user to ease into it, giving a break on harsh visuals.
- Opt for fades instead of slides for page transitions to prevent sensory overload.
- Custom-designed, soft, and hand-drawn-style icons to give more effect.
- Implement a slow and breathing-like heart animation that draws emotions and thoughts of comfort and calmness.
- Ensure all animations are devoid of timers and any sense of urgency.
